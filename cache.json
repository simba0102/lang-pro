It uses quantum bits, or qubits, instead of classical bits to perform computations. Unlike classical bits, which can only represent either 0 or 1, qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously, known as superposition. This allows quantum computers to perform certain computations much faster than classical computers.\\n\\nQuantum computing also leverages the principle of entanglement, which allows qubits to be correlated with each other in such a way that the state of one qubit is dependent on the state of another. This allows quantum computers to perform certain computations in parallel, which is not possible with classical computers.\\n\\nIn practical applications, quantum computing has the potential to solve problems that are intractable for classical computers, such as simulating complex quantum systems, searching large datasets, and optimizing complex functions.\\n\\nHowever, quantum computing is still in its early stages of development and there are many technical challenges that need to be overcome, such as improving the stability of qubits and developing more efficient algorithms.\"}],\"createdAt\":1676321753702},\"expires\":null}"}]],"lastExpire":1676312828824}
