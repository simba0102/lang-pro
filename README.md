# ChatGPT Clone #
## Wrap all conversational AIs under one roof. ##
  This project was originally created as a Minimum Viable Product (or MVP) for the Hack Reactor bootcamp. It was built with OpenAI response streaming and most of the UI completed in under 20 hours. You can find the [original product here]().

## Summary ##
  Conversational/Utility AIs are the future and OpenAI revolutionized this movement with ChatGPT. This app commemorates the original
  styling of ChatGPT, with the ability to integrate any current/future conversational AI models through user-provided APIs. While numerous methods exist to integrate conversational AIs, this app provides a simple, clean, and intuitive UI to interact with these models. I will most likely not deploy this app, but feel free to clone or fork to create your own custom wrapper.

## Roadmap

> **Warning**
> This is work in progress. I'm building this in public. You can follow the progress here or on my [Linkedin]().
> Here are my planned/recently finished features.

- [x] AI Model Selection
- [ ] Conversation/Prompt Search
- [ ] Semantic Search Option (requires more tokens)
- [ ] Config file for easy startup

### Features

- Utilizes waylaidwanderer's chatgpt-api package for current conversational AIs
- Response streaming identical to ChatGPT
- Styling from original ChatGPT, including Dark mode
- Use of Tailwind CSS (just like )and [shadcn/ui]() components
- AI model selection
- API key input

## Use Case ##

  ![use case example](./use_case.png "GPT is down! Plus is too expensive!")
  ChatGPT is down ( and don't want to pay for ChatGPT Plus). ChatGPT/Google Bard/Bing AI conversations are lost in space or
  cannot be searched past a certain timeframe.


## Solution ##
  Serves and searches all conversations reliably. All AI convos under one house.
  Pay per call and not per month (cents compared to dollars).

## How to Get Started ##
  Input your API key(s) and you're ready to go.
